# Birdie Cat

> An Android Game made in Unity, using a **Fuzzy Logic** machine to calculate which level of difficult the player is.

## Introduction
The game is used to demonstrate the application of fuzzy logic in the creation of a dynamic difficulty curve. It was designed from the beginning of its development process to apply this concept. Hence, an adaptive system was developed for the difficulty control of the game Birdie Cat. What is more, a bank of rules was built to discover the userâ€™s capability using Fuzzy Logic, receiving input variables such as score, mortality rate, and among other variables.

## Project
Birdie Cat was selected on the SBGames Brazil 2017 to the category of Student Game, unfortunately was not select between the best three. Anyway it was between the 10 best games from Brazilians students in that year ðŸ˜¸.
