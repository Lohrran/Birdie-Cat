## Introduction
The game is used to demonstrate the application of fuzzy logic in the creation of a dynamic difficulty curve. It was designed from the beginning of its development process to apply this concept. Hence, an adaptive system was developed for the difficulty control of the game Birdie Cat. What is more, a bank of rules was built to discover the userâ€™s capability using Fuzzy Logic, receiving input variables such as score, mortality rate, and among other variables.

## Project
